# That dreaded calculation

## Growth
Placements 30 linear regression, days vs placements (x,y)
Then seven day average of regressions

85% and 95%

Use 30 day average for placement: 176
current census: 8069-ish

-------
Number of kids to be discharged: (Census + 7 day average placement + (number of days * growth rate)) * (30 day discharge rate)

New census = current census - number of kids discharged

n

---------

with growth

(7 day average referrals + (number of days * growth rate))

---------

Variables:
Census day 0
7 day referrals
discharge rate 30 day
Growth

CensusND = Census(N-1) - (CensusN-1*discharge rate)
CenususN = CensusND + (7day avg referrals + growthrate * day number)
